## Hi there üëã
# About Me
---
My name is Eter Ennada, a versatile developer with a passion for creating and learning new technologies. I began my journey in the IT industry during high school, where I explored a range of technologies from software to web development, including JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Pascal, and HTML.

In 2023, I deepened my programming knowledge by taking the CS50 class, where I learned Python, Django, C, and CSS. This experience propelled me into the world of freelance projects, allowing me to apply and expand my skills.

Beyond the tech world, I have a penchant for experimenting with new food recipes, tailoring them to my taste, and indulging in gaming during my downtime.

Additionally, I contribute to the growth of local businesses by enhancing their online presence through monitoring and advisory roles.
